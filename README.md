# CS300-DSA: Analysis and Design

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course project, I was tasked with developing efficient software for the course planner at ABC University that would allow computer science advisors to easily access course information for students.
 
### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem, I created pseudocode and performed runtime analysis using various data structures such as hash tables, vectors, and trees. Understanding data structures is important because it allows developers to organize and store data in an efficient manner, which in turn can improve the performance of programs.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

One major roadblock was my lack of proficiency in C++. To overcome this, I frequently utilized resources such as Stack Overflow and Google to debug errors.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has expanded my knowledge and use of data structures, which has allowed me to optimize code for better maintainability, scalability, and efficiency.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has taught me the importance of good programming practices, such as creating a pseudocode layout and planning before coding. This has allowed me to write programs that are easier to maintain, read, and adapt in the future.
